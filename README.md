# [Data Handling With Python][published url]
## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]



Python is a well-known and powerful language that is easy to learn and excels at many different types of computing. It is used to run large, well know websites. It is used to process log files and make sense of their contents. It might even be used to create some of your favorite games!

If you followed along with [Introduction to Python](https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/introduction-to-python), you probably have a good feel for the basics, but when you look around on the internet there are more things that you still don't understand. Maybe you've been hearing about "comprehensions". Or maybe you've seen the `map` or `filter` functions used and wonder exactly what they do. What about files? How do you read from them or write to them? 

If you've ever wanted to go deeper with Python, then this is the course for you. In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Derek Jensen will take you through some of the basics of handling data in the Python language. For starters, you'll learn about advanced use of commonly used data structures. Later on, Derek will share some pointers with you about how to get data in and out of files and even store complex data structures in them. Let's not wait any longer! Time to dive on in.
